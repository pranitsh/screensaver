# Countdown Timer Screensaver
Countdown Timer screensaver is a countdown timer till the end of the day providing a black background and burn-in protection for android screens.

## Features
- Countdown timer to the end of the day with date.
- Weather info.
  - Helpfully provides the next time it will start or stop raining/snowing!*
- Prevents the screen from closing and has a full screen mode.
- Burn-in protection for oled screens.
  - Smooth transitions when moving around.
- An app that works on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and possibly anything POSIX through the browser's progressive web app feature!

Do fork and try out the project. Leave a star if you use it! Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md for help.

## Why I made it?
- Widgets cannot be updated every second on Android. It is only possible to update them every minute for battery life reasons.
- There are surprisingly few options in android for activating a screensaver (preventing this approach on android).
- Always on displays do not have countdown timer features (checked six of them).
- Imagine how much we could accomplish if all clocks counted down instead of up. No countdown app I found had this and burn-in protection for amoled screens.
- Although I could pay for a version of this without all the features I want, I wouldn't get to experiment with progressive web apps!!! This works like an app like any other on Android and iOS.

*This app is for non-commerical purposes.
