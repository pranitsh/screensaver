# timer_screensaver
Countdown Timer screensaver is a countdown timer till the end of the day providing a black background and burn-in protection for android screens.

## Why I made it?
- Widgets cannot be updated every second. It is only possible to update them every hour for battery life reasons.
- There are surprisingly few options in android for activating a screensaver (preventing this approach).
- I wanted a clock that counts down.
- I'm not willing to pay money for this.
