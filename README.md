# timer_screensaver
Countdown Timer screensaver is a countdown timer till the end of the day providing a black background and burn-in protection for android screens.

## Why I made it?
- Widgets cannot be updated every second. It is only possible to update them every hour for battery life reasons.
- There are surprisingly few options in android for activating a screensaver (preventing this approach).
- Imagine how much we could accomplish if all clocks counted down instead of up. Surprisingly little of this exists.
- I'm not willing to pay money for what is essentially a countdown timer that took less than three hours to build. (Mainly, this is just an experiment with progressive web apps.)
